### Square
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

### Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

### Sum
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples
GetSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1

GetSum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3

GetSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1

GetSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same

GetSum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1

GetSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
